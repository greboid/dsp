=== Docker Socket Proxy

It is intended to be as simple as possible to allow a proxy to serve containers without needing full access to the
docker socket.

Exposes the docker socket on disk, over http (defaults to 8080).  The only changes that can be made are a set of
kill signals to individual containers, defaults to just HUP.
