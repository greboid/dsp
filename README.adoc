= Docker Socket Proxy

It is intended to be as simple as possible to allow a proxy to serve container without needing full access to the
docker socket by exposing the docker socket (unix socket) via HTTP

== Allowed endpoints
- `POST /containers/+{id}+/kill`: Allowed only with permitted signals
- `POST /`: Other POST requests are denied
- `GET /`: All GET requests are allowed

== Configuration Options

The application accepts the following command-line flags, which can also be set via environment variables:

- `-socket` (default: `/var/run/docker.sock`): Path to the Docker socket
- `-proxyPort` (default: `8080`): Port for the proxy to listen on
- `-killSignals` (default: `HUP`): Space-separated list of permissible kill signals

Environment variables: `SOCKET`, `PROXYPORT`, `KILLSIGNALS`

== Logging Options

The following logging configuration options:

- `-log-format` (default: `text`): Log format, either `text` or `json`
- `-log-level` (default: `info`): Minimum log level to output (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`)
- `-log-time` (default: `false`): Whether to include timestamps in logs
- `-log-source` (default: `false`): Whether to include source file and line information in logs

Environment variables: `LOG_FORMAT`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_TIME`, `LOG_SOURCE`
